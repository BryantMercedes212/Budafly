        <h4>Is weed legal in New York?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, it is. Both recreational and medical cannabis are legal in the
          Empire State.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Cannabis has been decriminalized in New York since 2019.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Legislation history</h4>
        <p>
          After nearly legalizing marijuana in 2019, New York passed SB 854-A,
          the Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act, in March 2021 after ironing
          out issues over impaired driving and social equity. The bill legalized
          purchasing, possessing, and transporting up to 3 ounces (85 grams) of
          weed and up to 24 grams of concentrate for adults 21 and older. It
          also established the Office of Cannabis Management to oversee all
          related matters â€” medical, recreational, and hemp.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also set up licensing guidelines for growers, producers,
          distributors, and retailers while attempting to address long-standing
          issues around race, social equity, and enforcement of cannabis laws.
          Automatic expungement or resentencing was included for those convicted
          of acts no longer considered illegal.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019 New York seemed poised to become the first state to create a
          legal, regulated marijuana market through the legislative process.
          After debating the legalization of all marijuana, the legislature was
          unable to come to a consensus, with divisions mostly over social
          equity provisions. However, lawmakers did expand a 1977 law that
          decriminalized cannabis. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the
          decriminalization bill into law on July 29, 2019, and it went into
          effect a month later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medical marijuana was legalized in 2014 under New York's Compassionate
          Care Act, or S7923, which permitted the possession, use, manufacture,
          delivery, transport, and administration of medical marijuana by
          patients and designated caregivers.
        </p>
        <h4>Regulation authority</h4>
        <p>
          The Medical Marijuana Program (MMP), under the auspices of the
          Department of Health, oversees the medical cannabis registry as well
          as certification, purchasing, and dispensing for patients and
          caregivers. The MMP also manages the certification, registry, and
          regulation of practitioners and dispensing facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March, 2021, new legislation established the Office of Cannabis
          Management to oversee all cannabis matters in the state, once it's up
          and running.
        </p>
        <h4>Where is it safe to purchase cannabis in New York?</h4>
        New York has passed new legislation so things are in flux but for now,
        certified patients can purchase medical cannabis from state-regulated
        organizations operating dispensaries throughout the state. Patients must
        bring their registry ID cards and certifications. They are allowed to
        purchase a 60-day supply of cannabis in forms specified by their doctor.
        Designated caregivers obtaining medical marijuana on behalf of patients
        need their caregiver registry identification cards and their patients'
        certifications. Some registered organizations also offer online
        ordering. 
        <h4>Possessing cannabis in New York</h4> 
        After the passage of the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act in March 2021, adults 21 and older can possess up to 3 ounces (85 grams) of cannabis and 24 grams of cannabis concentrate. 
        Registered patients may hold up to a 60-day supply of an approved medical cannabis product at any time. Patients and designated caregivers must have their medical marijuana registry ID card
        on hand at all times when possessing medical cannabis. 
        Vaporizing or smoking approved medical cannabis products is illegal in places where tobacco smoking is prohibited. It is also illegal to vaporize a medical marijuana product within 100 feet (30.5 meters) of public or private school grounds, unless on private property. Consuming medical cannabis is illegal in motor vehicles on public and private roads or parked in any lot. Marijuana products may not be transported outside of New York.
        <h4>Medical Marijuana Registry Program</h4> 
        The MMP is the portal through which New York patients register for identification cards and are granted access to cannabis from approved dispensaries. To register, patients must first contact a practitioner registered with the Department of Health and be certified with a qualifying condition. Patients must be New York residents or temporarily residing in the state for medical treatment. Once certified, patients create an account online. Once approved, they receive a temporary registry identification card, which may be used in conjunction with a government-issued photo ID to purchase
        approved medical marijuana products until the permanent registry ID card
        arrives. Registrations expire when the certification issued by the
        practitioner expires based on the prescription. Patients and caregivers
        must re-register each time a new certification number is issued. The
        state charges a $50 application fee for patients and caregivers, but the
        fee may be waived or reduced for financial hardship. The list of health
        professionals who can certify patients includes nurse practitioners and
        physician assistants. Practitioners are required to complete a
        Department of Health-approved education course, create an account, and
        register with the Health Commerce System. 
        <h4>Rules for caregivers</h4> 
        A certified patient may designate up to two caregivers during the
        registration process. Patients can designate certain facilities as
        caregivers, although facility participation is optional. After being
        designated by a patient, caregivers are required to go through the same
        application process as patients and must also carry the required
        identification. Once approved, the caregiver can assist up to four
        patients in obtaining, possessing, and administering medical marijuana.
        Caregivers are allowed to possess up to a 60-day supply of marijuana on
        behalf of each patient. Marijuana must be in the proper consumption
        forms and dosages for the specified patients. 
        <h4>Qualifying conditions</h4>

        <li>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease</li>

        <h4>Reciprocity</h4>
        Certifications or registry ID cards from other states are not accepted.
        <h4>Lab testing</h4> 
        All medical cannabis products must be tested by an
        independent laboratory certified by the Department of Health's
        Environmental Laboratory Approval Program. Products are tested for their
        cannabinoid profile, as well as the following microbiological, metal,
        and chemical contaminants: Aflatoxin Antimony Arsenic Aspergillus
        Bile-tolerant gram-negative bacteria Cadmium Chromium Copper Escherichia
