            <p>To be successful, I realized it was imperative to take a step back and take a look at the whole process of cannabis product creation from seed, cultivation, handling, wholesale, product packaging, and finally the consumer experience.
            <br></br>
            I realized there are ample opportunities to improve the cannabis space so I started visiting multiple farms and speaking with farmers to ensure the production process was not only adequate but superior to what was already available in the market.
            <br></br>
            I hope you, the customer, can decide if itâ€™s the right product for you.</p>
